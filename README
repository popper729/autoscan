A way to automate the initial steps of a pentest

usage: python3 autoscan.py [hostfile]

Given a hostfile (formulated like what would be sent to nmap), this script can do the following:
 - Run an nmap scan of a set number of top ports
 - Examine the results of the nmap scan and find all open port 80 and 443
   - Given the results of this, run gobuster and nikto on each of these hosts
Note: the gobuster scan will look for /usr/share/wordlists/averroes/raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt. If it doesn't find this file, it will look in the local folder. If it still doesn't find it, it will pull it from the internet (with a wget)

There is no guarantee of compatibility with python2.x

FUTURE WORK
 - Create a menu for more personalized scans (just running gobuster/nikto and not nmap for example)
 - Search ports for http/https (don't limit results to 80/443, also check if 80/443 are actually web ports)
 - Specify in command line the wordlist for gobuster
 - Specify in command line the ports to scan/the number of top ports to scan
 - Better handle gobuster/nikto errors
 - Add aquatone option
 - Automate other types of scans as available
 - Add social media scraping for a target (may require seperate project)
