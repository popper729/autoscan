A way to automate the initial steps of a pentest

usage: python3 autoscan.py {-i [host]|-I [hostfile]} {-p [ports]|-P [top ports]|-f|-q} -g -n -d -u
Host selection (required):
 -i [host] 	specify a single host
 -I [hostfile] 	specify a file with one host per line
Port selection:
 -p 		specify the port or ports to scan
 -P		specify the number of top ports to scan (defined by nmap)
 -f		scan all ports (1-65535)
 -q		ping scan only (no ports)
Other options:
 -d		scan all specified hosts (no ping scan)
 -u		perform UDP scan
 -g		run gobuster on all web hosts
 -n		run nikto on all web hosts

Note: the gobuster scan will look for /usr/share/wordlists/averroes/raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt. If it doesn't find this file, it will look in the local folder. If it still doesn't find it, it will pull it from the internet (with a wget)

There is no guarantee of compatibility with python2.x

FUTURE WORK
 - Create a menu for more personalized scans (just running gobuster/nikto and not nmap for example)
 - Search ports for http/https (don't limit results to 80/443, also check if 80/443 are actually web ports)
 - Specify in command line the wordlist for gobuster
 - Better handle gobuster/nikto errors
 - Add aquatone option
 - Automate other types of scans as available
 - Add social media scraping for a target (may require seperate project)
